# Touch Screen Support for Floorplan Editor

## Overview
The floorplan editor now fully supports touch screen devices for creating and editing restaurant layouts. This implementation adds comprehensive touch gestures while preserving all existing mouse functionality.

## Touch Controls

### Basic Interactions
- **Single Tap**: Select objects, place furniture, or interact with UI elements
- **Long Press (500ms)**: Enter rotation mode for selected object
- **Drag**: Move selected furniture around the floorplan
- **Double Tap**: Quick actions (reserved for future features)

### Advanced Gestures
- **Two-Finger Pinch**: Scale objects up or down
- **Two-Finger Rotation**: Rotate objects (in rotation mode)
- **Two-Finger Pan**: Navigate the 3D view (via OrbitControls)

### Object Manipulation

#### Moving Objects
1. Tap on any furniture item to select it
2. Drag to move the object to a new position
3. The object will snap to the floor grid automatically

#### Rotating Objects
1. Long press on an object (hold for 500ms)
2. Rotation mode indicator will appear
3. Drag to rotate the object around its center
4. Tap elsewhere to exit rotation mode

#### Scaling Objects
1. Select an object with a single tap
2. Use two fingers to pinch in/out for scaling
3. Scale feedback shows current scale value
4. Release to apply the new scale

### Wall Placement
- Tap the wall tool to enter wall mode
- Tap and drag to create walls
- Touch preview shows wall placement in real-time
- Tap to place wall endpoints

### Door and Window Placement
- Select door or window tool from toolbar
- Tap on existing walls to place openings
- Touch preview shows placement position
- Compatible with all existing wall structures

## Visual Feedback

### Touch Indicators
- **Touch Pulse**: Visual feedback appears at touch points
- **Rotation Indicator**: Shows when rotation mode is active
- **Scaling Feedback**: Displays current scale during pinch gestures
- **Help Overlay**: Auto-appears on touch devices with gesture guide

### Status Indicators
- **Rotation Mode**: Blue indicator shows rotation is active
- **Scaling Mode**: Orange indicator shows scaling is active
- **Object Highlighting**: Selected objects glow with blue outline

## Technical Implementation

### TouchManager Class
- **Location**: `/scripts/managers/TouchManager.js`
- **Purpose**: Handles all touch events separately from mouse events
- **Integration**: Works alongside existing UIManager and DragManager

### Key Features
- **Multi-touch Support**: Handles up to 10 simultaneous touch points
- **Gesture Recognition**: Differentiates between taps, drags, long presses
- **Conflict Prevention**: Touch events don't interfere with mouse events
- **Device Detection**: Automatically activates on touch-capable devices

### Event Handling
```javascript
// Touch events handled:
- touchstart: Object selection, gesture initiation
- touchmove: Dragging, rotation, scaling
- touchend: Gesture completion, tap detection
- touchcancel: Cleanup and state reset
```

## Device Compatibility

### Supported Devices
- ✅ iPad (all models)
- ✅ iPhone (landscape mode recommended)
- ✅ Android tablets
- ✅ Android phones (landscape mode recommended)
- ✅ Windows tablets with touch
- ✅ Surface devices
- ✅ Chrome OS touch devices

### Browser Support
- ✅ Safari (iOS/macOS)
- ✅ Chrome (Android/Desktop)
- ✅ Firefox (Android/Desktop)
- ✅ Edge (Windows)

## Performance Optimizations

### Touch Response
- Touch events use `passive: false` for precise control
- Gesture recognition with debouncing for smooth performance
- Visual feedback with hardware-accelerated animations
- Memory-efficient touch point tracking

### Responsive Design
- Touch targets minimum 44px for accessibility
- Adaptive UI elements for different screen sizes
- High DPI display support for crisp visuals
- Optimized for both portrait and landscape orientations

## Accessibility Features

### Touch Accessibility
- Large touch targets for easy interaction
- Clear visual feedback for all gestures
- Help overlay with gesture explanations
- Haptic feedback support (where available)

### Visual Indicators
- High contrast mode support
- Clear state indicators for colorblind users
- Motion-reduced alternatives for sensitive users
- Screen reader compatible touch descriptions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Touch Not Responding
1. Ensure browser supports touch events
2. Check if device has touch capabilities
3. Refresh page if touch events seem stuck
4. Verify no browser zoom is applied

#### Gestures Not Working
1. Make sure to use firm, deliberate touches
2. Check if multiple objects are overlapping
3. Ensure sufficient space for gesture recognition
4. Verify touch area is within canvas bounds

#### Performance Issues
1. Close other browser tabs for better performance
2. Restart browser if touch becomes laggy
3. Check available device memory
4. Ensure stable internet connection for asset loading

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode by adding `?debug=touch` to the URL to see:
- Touch point visualization
- Gesture recognition logs
- Performance metrics
- Event timing information

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Haptic feedback for touch gestures
- [ ] Voice commands for accessibility
- [ ] Custom gesture recording and playback
- [ ] Multi-user collaborative touch editing
- [ ] Touch-optimized furniture library browser

### Gesture Improvements
- [ ] Three-finger gestures for advanced functions
- [ ] Pressure-sensitive scaling on supported devices
- [ ] Tilt-based rotation using device orientation
- [ ] Edge swipe gestures for quick tool switching

## Developer Notes

### Code Structure
```
TouchManager.js - Main touch handling logic
├── Touch event listeners
├── Gesture recognition
├── Visual feedback systems
├── State management
└── Integration with existing managers
```

### Adding New Touch Features
1. Extend TouchManager class with new methods
2. Add corresponding visual feedback in CSS
3. Update help overlay with new gestures
4. Test across multiple touch devices
5. Update this documentation

### Testing Guidelines
- Test on actual touch devices, not browser emulation
- Verify touch works alongside mouse on hybrid devices
- Check performance with multiple simultaneous touches
- Validate accessibility with screen readers
- Test in various orientations and screen sizes
